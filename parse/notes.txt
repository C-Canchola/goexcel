Need a data structure to aggregate tables
based off headers.

Take in variadic ParsedSheets

Ability to somehow define where the header begins
    - may have to

Header is array of strings
Have originally formatted data as string
Also decimal formatted data as string
    - This allows additional parsing not using schema.
